![Screenshot](./assets/humaira.png)

## Controls

| Key | Action        |
| --- | ------------- |
| W   | Move forward  |
| S   | Move backward |
| A   | Turn left     |
| D   | Turn right    |

## Purpose

- The purpose of the project was/is `Recreational programming`.
- The extreme use of `OOP` is not necessary at all. Sorry non-oop dudes!
- Although there are `6` classes in the whole program, the only actually helpful class is the
  `Coordinate` class. All others can be omitted.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- Pygame 2.6.1 or later
